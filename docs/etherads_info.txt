     <li>EtherAds.co is currently only running on the Rinkeby test network.</li>
     <li>In order to purchase an EtherAd you need to use the <a href="https://metamask.io" title="MetaMask" target="_blank">Metamask</a> plugin for Chrome or FireFox. Mobile users should try a new web3 dapp browser called <a href="https://www.cipherbrowser.com" title="Cipher" target="_blank">Cipher</a>.</li>
     <li>Each EtherAd is an <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-currently/the-anatomy-of-erc721-e9db77abfc24" title="ERC721" target="_blank">ERC721 Token</a> that is represented by a keyword. Think CryptoKitties except the characteristics of an EtherAd are it's keyword, url and image source instead of a cute but otherwise worthless image of a cat.  Every EtherAd will exist forever on the Ethereum Blockchain.  Collect them all, trade with our friends and prepare to battle!</li>
     <li>To buy an EtherAd simply set the new url and image source and press the buy button.  Make sure that your link and image are accurate because you will not be able to change them (unless you buy the EtherAd back from someone else.)</li>
     <li>The starting price for each EtherAd is 0.001 ETH (plus gas fees).  <a href="https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/gas/what-is-gas-ethereum.html" title="gas" target="_blank">WTF is Gas?</a> I only rock Teslas. Gas is basically the cost of doing business on the Ethereum Blockchain, you gotta pay to play!</li>
     <li>Each time an EtherAd is bought its future selling price doubles.</li>
     <li>If someone else buys your EtherAd, you will get two thirds of the selling price back.</li>
      <ul><li>For example the first time an EtherAd is sold the cost is 0.001 ETH.</li>
          <li>If someone wants to buy your EtherAd, they have to pay 0.002 ETH and you get 0.00134 ETH back.  So you bought your EtherAd for 0.001 and got 0.00134 when you sold it.  Bam! You just made 0.00034. </li>
          <li>The next time that EtherAd sells its price will be 0.004 and the seller receives 0.002684 ETH.  He bought it for 0.002 and got 0.002684.  A difference of 0.000684.  Mo Money, Mo Money!</li>
      </ul> 
     <li>Did I mention EtherAds will be around forever?  <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/EtherAds.co" title="IPFS" target="_blank">Look Ma, no server!</a> I know it's slow now but the IPFS team is working on it.</li>
